# Checklist rules

If you are running a task checklist, always follow the steps sequentially. 
Do not proceed to the next task unless the current task is completed. 
Do not perform work other than what is requested or specified in the checklist.
Ensure you update the checklist by marking task completion, before stepping to the next task.
