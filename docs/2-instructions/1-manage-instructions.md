# Manage Instructions

## What are Instructions?

Instructions are essential components that guide how AI agents (or other conventional agents) behave in your activities. Think of instructions as a set of rules and guidelines that define:

- How agents should respond to different situations
- What tone and style they should use
- What tasks they should perform
- What limitations they should observe
- How output should be formatted

Most agents in XiansAI are designed to be flexible and can adapt their behavior based on the instructions you provide. This allows you to customize agents for different use cases without creating new ones from scratch.

## Creating Instructions

To create new instructions:

1. Log in to the XiansAI portal
2. Navigate to the Instructions section
3. Click the "Create New Instruction" button

### Best Practices for Writing Instructions

- Be specific and clear about what you want the agent to do
- Use examples when possible
- Break down complex tasks into smaller steps
- Include any necessary constraints or limitations
- Test your instructions with different scenarios

## Versioning Instructions

Instructions in XiansAI support versioning, allowing you to:

- Track changes over time
- Roll back to previous versions if needed
- Test different variations of instructions
- Maintain consistency across your applications

### Creating New Versions

To create a new version:

1. Open the instruction details page
2. Click the 'Create New Version' button
3. Make your changes to the instruction content
4. Save the new version

### Version Management

- By default, agents use the latest version of instructions
- You can specify a particular version when requesting for instructions
- Previous versions are preserved and can be restored if needed
