# Learning & Contribution Path

Welcome to the Xians AI Platform development journey! Follow this structured path to become proficient in building AI agents and contributing to the platform.

---

## üéì Phase 1: Explore and Learn

### Get Started with the Platform

- [ ] Login to [agentri.ai](https://agentri.ai) (hosted version of Xians.AI platform)
- [ ] Join the existing tenant **99x** and request admin approval
- [ ] Read [Why Xians Platform](https://xiansaiplatform.github.io/XiansAi.PublicDocs/0-architecture/1-why-xians-platform/) to understand how AI agents differ from conventional software
- [ ] Review the [complete documentation](https://xiansaiplatform.github.io/XiansAi.PublicDocs/) to understand how Xians.AI helps developers build AI Agent systems

### Make Your First Contribution

- [ ] Send a PR to the [documentation repository](https://github.com/XiansAiPlatform/XiansAi.PublicDocs) to improve documentation

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Phase 2: Setting Up Development Environment

- [ ] Set up [Xians Community Edition](https://github.com/XiansAiPlatform/community-edition) locally on your machine
- [ ] Verify your local setup is working correctly

---

## ü§ñ Phase 3: Simple Agent Development

Build your first agents and learn core concepts:

### Basic Chat Agent

- [ ] Develop a [simple chat agent](https://xiansaiplatform.github.io/XiansAi.PublicDocs/1-getting-started/2-first-agent/#testing-your-setup)
- [ ] Test and verify the agent responds correctly

### Add Functionality

- [ ] [Add Capabilities](https://xiansaiplatform.github.io/XiansAi.PublicDocs/1-getting-started/3-adding-capabilities/) to your agent
- [ ] Integrate [MCPs (Model Context Protocol)](https://xiansaiplatform.github.io/XiansAi.PublicDocs/n-encyclopedia/mcp-integration/) into your agent

### Workflow Automation
- [ ] Create a [Deterministic Workflow](https://xiansaiplatform.github.io/XiansAi.PublicDocs/1-getting-started/4-new-business-process/) for your agent
- [ ] [Schedule the deterministic flow](https://xiansaiplatform.github.io/XiansAi.PublicDocs/4-automation/2-flow-scheduling/) for automated execution

---

## üë• Phase 4: Agent Teams

Learn to build multi-agent systems:

- [ ] Study an Agent team implementation such as **Percy** ([Internal Repo](https://github.com/99x-Internal/Percy))
- [ ] Implement an Agent with **Agent2Agent communication** in a multi-agent team setup
- [ ] Build a **SuperAgent** (Team Lead) that can:
  - Discuss with users to understand requirements
  - Create automations dynamically
  - Coordinate with other agents (reference Percy's SuperAgent implementation)

---

## üîß Phase 5: Platform Development

Contribute to the core platform:

### Setup Core Repositories

- [ ] Clone and set up the following repositories locally:
  - [XiansAi.Server](https://github.com/XiansAiPlatform/XiansAi.Server)
  - [XiansAi.UI](https://github.com/XiansAiPlatform/XiansAi.UI)
  - [XiansAi.Lib](https://github.com/XiansAiPlatform/XiansAi.Lib)
- [ ] Configure your existing agent development projects to use the local Lib and Server

### Contribute to Platform

- [ ] Make improvements to the platform repositories (e.g., unit tests, UI enhancements)
- [ ] Test your changes thoroughly
- [ ] Submit a Pull Request with your improvements

### Join Platform Development

- [ ] Review tasks in the [XiansAI Platform project board](https://github.com/orgs/XiansAiPlatform/projects/1)
- [ ] Pick up a task and contribute to platform development
