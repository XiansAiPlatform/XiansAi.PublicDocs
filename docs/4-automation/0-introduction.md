# Process Automation

## Introduction

Unlike conventional automation tools that follow rigid, pre-programmed rules, AI agents possess the intelligence to understand context, make informed decisions, adapt to changing conditions, and learn from experience.

## Core Requirements for AI Agent Automation

To effectively automate business processes, AI agents must possess several critical capabilities that enable them to operate reliably in enterprise environments:

### 1. External Trigger Responsiveness

AI agents must be able to respond to various external stimuli that initiate business processes. This includes real-time event processing, webhook handling, and integration with external systems and APIs.

**[External Triggers](1-external-triggers.md)**: Learn how to configure AI agents to respond to external events and triggers

### 2. Scheduled and Periodic Execution

Many business processes require execution at specific times or intervals. AI agents need robust scheduling capabilities to handle recurring tasks, time-based triggers, and complex scheduling patterns.

**[Scheduled Execution](2-scheduled-execution.md)**: Implement time-based and periodic process automation

### 3. Fault Tolerance and Resilience

Enterprise environments demand high reliability. AI agents must gracefully handle failures, implement retry mechanisms, maintain process state during interruptions, and provide comprehensive error handling.

**[Fault Tolerance](3-fault-tolerance.md)**: Build resilient AI agents that handle failures gracefully

### 4. Long-Running Process Support

Complex business processes often span extended periods, requiring agents to maintain context, manage state persistence, handle checkpoints, and coordinate across multiple phases of execution.
