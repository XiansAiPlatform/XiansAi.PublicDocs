# How Temporal workflows are used in agents

## Workflow Types

One agent can have multiple workflows (workflow types). This is because complex agents offer many different responsibilities and having a single workflow for an agent would make it too complex.

## Sub-workflows

If a particular workflow calls another workflow, the latter becomes a sub-workflow, and the calling workflow is the parent workflow.

## Workflow Id

Workflows can have a custom id. If not specified at start, a default id is generated by temporal. Only one running workflow can have a given id at a time. Workflow ids are useful for sending signals to a workflow. Also 'StartWithSignal' can be used to start a new workflow execution with a given id.

## Workflow Run Id

A workflow run id is the id of a single run of a workflow. Workflow with the same ID can have multiple Runs. If a workflow is terminated or failed, it can be restarted with the same id. Also if a workflow if 'ContinueAsNew' is called, the new workflow is given the same id but a different run id.

## Structure on the UI

- Agent: <Agent-name> on Assignment: <assignment-name>
    - Workflow id  (<agent-name>-<assignment-name>-<workflow-type>-<custom-key>)
      - Workflow run id
      - Workflow run id
      - Workflow run id
        - Sub-workflow id  (<agent-name>-<assignment-name>-<workflow-type>-<custom-key>)
            - Workflow run id
    - Workflow id  (<agent-name>-<assignment-name>-<workflow-type>-<custom-key>)
      - Workflow run id
