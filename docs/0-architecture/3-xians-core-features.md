# Xians Platform Features

Xians Platform is an open-source & LLM-agnostic framework for building AI agents. It provides a set of tools and libraries for building agents, as well as a management platform for deploying and monitoring agents.

## Core Features

### **Enterprise-Grade Workflow Engine**

Xians ADK leverages temporal.io workflow engine to execute agent activities, making your applications fault-tolerant, scalable, and capable of managing long-running processes that can operate for months or years. Combine generative orchestration with deterministic workflows to create applications that are both adaptive and produce consistent, reliable results.

### **Sophisticated Agent Architecture**

Design agents using familiar software development patterns. Support true multi-agent systems with peer-to-peer agent handoffs as well as hierarchical agent team collaboration where agents are aware of each other's capabilities. This structured approach makes agent creation more predictable and maintainable while supporting both assistive and autonomous execution modes to suit your business requirements.

Coordinate complex tasks through explicit workflows or emergent agent cooperation. Xians enables peer-to-peer agent handoffs and team-based collaboration where agents are aware of each other's capabilities.

### **Event-Driven Agent Communication**

User-2-Agent and Agent-2-Agent communication is seamless through sophisticated communication mechanisms (WebSockets, REST, SSE), enabling complex coordination without tight coupling.

### **Agent Resource Management**

Xians ADK includes a full-featured Agent Management Portal and built-in Agent run UI, providing total visibility into agent definitions, processes, activities, logs, and a knowledge management portal for agent use. This comprehensive platform approach eliminates the need to build custom interfaces for agent management. Monitor and debug your agents with comprehensive tracing, logging, and evaluation capabilities.

### **Multi-Tenant Support**

Built from the ground up for multi-tenancy, Xians ADK is the most suitable platform for sophisticated product development and enterprise deployments where isolation and customization per tenant are critical requirements.

### **Flexible Deployment**

Deploy your agents anywhere with our flexible deployment options. Run locally during development, scale in cloud environments, or integrate into existing infrastructure with container support and standardized interfaces. Xians ADK ensures no vendor lock-in, whether to a specific LLM model, provider, or cloud platform.

### **Enterprise-Ready Security**

Build agents that meet organizational requirements with our security-first design. Implement fine-grained permissions, input validation, and output filtering to create trustworthy AI systems.
